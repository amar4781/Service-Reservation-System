# Service-Reservation-System

### Business Requirements Understanding:

This system's main goal is to provide online coaching session services to users so that they do not have to go to the coach and waste time. The user can book any session at the time he wants and see the dates of the reservations he has made. At the same time, the coach can add session services and display them to users, modify or delete them, and also see the reservations to see the names of the users who have booked and can accept or cancel the reservation. This system facilitates the communication process between users and the coach.


### Feature Suggestion:

We want to add an automatic reminder message to users before the session starts so that they do not miss it. This will make the user not forget his session time and will encourage them to book other sessions and use this site all the time.
